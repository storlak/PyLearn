Slicing is to extract ranges of elements from Sequences.
start & stop positions (by index number)
start is inclusive and stop is exclusive.
for slicing [] for lists, strings and tuples etc
last element index +1 or s[6:] and first element 0 or s [:6]
[:] this is a shallow copy of the sequence.
[start:stop:step]
[2:10:2]
    - start at 2 and include index 2
    - stop at 10 and exclude index 10
    - move in steps of 2
