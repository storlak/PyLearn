When we copy a sequence there are 2 types of copying:

    1. shallow copy:
        - a new copy
        - a new sequence but same elements referring to same objects.
        - add, remove, etc to shallow doesn't affect the original.
        - add, remove the original will effect the shallow copy.
    ORIGINAL IS SHALLOW COPY ------>>>> FALSE

    2. deep copy: from copy import deepcopy
        - also a new copy and a new sequence created
        - totally new and independent objects!
        - deepcopy == everything independent each other.
