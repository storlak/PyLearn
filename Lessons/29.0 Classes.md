## Classes
Everything in Python is an object ---> has a type.(float, int, decimal etc.)
That type is also called a "Class". It has "State" and "Function"
Classes: Bluprints for creating objects. A single Class can be used to create multiple instances.
    Each Instance will have its own state.

### Creating a Class
Use class keyword:
    class Person():
We can define the state + functionality
