## Classes
Everything in Python is an object ---> has a type.(float, int, decimal etc.)
That type is also called a "Class". It has "State" and "Function"
Classes: Bluprints for creating objects. A single Class can be used to create multiple instances.
    * Each instance will have its own state.

### Creating a Class
Use class keyword:
    class Person():
We can define the state + functionality

### Initialization
* __init__ when we create a new class
* it is a method bound to a new object inside the class
* we can define additional parameters!
